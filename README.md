Code to simulation test single-species decision rules across predator-prey scenarios using management strategy evaluation (MSE). Code uses the [Rceattle](https://github.com/grantdadams/Rceattle) package (master branch). Experiments are applied to data from commercial fisheries in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. The management strategy evaluation includes data simulation, assessment (estimation methods), and decision rules used across the US and Australia. Simulations are summarized by a variety of performance metrics.

- The source Rceattle package is included in the main directory.
- Code to run the MSE is in the main directory.
- Supporting functions are in the "R" and "R/Functions" folders.
